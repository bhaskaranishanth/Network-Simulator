How does dynamic routing work because neither TCP Reno nor TCP Vegas change routing tables; they just change the window size.

How exactly does the event queue work if they are happening at different times?

Do we only report congestion after the end of the entire program? Or do we report it mid way too? 

How do we understand time in this simulation?

Same time events? How does it work?

Can we have IP as strings?





Does the ack packet go through the link as fast as possible?
It is possible for the ack packets to come out of order, right?


For TCP Reno, can we use global knowledge (i.e. dropped packets) to change a host's window size?
